    germany_1941.4.desc:0 "When we first came to Ukraine, the people of Ukraine hailed us as their saviours. Being oppressed heavily by the Soviet Union, purposefully starved, massacred and more, they saw the German Reich as their liberator. With the recent occupation of Ukrainian clay, the occupier had to decide on their policy against the Ukrainians. There are many considered \"unworthy\" by the German people, such as Slavs and Jews. What shall we do?"

    germany_1941.5.d:0 "The Uprising in Serbia was initiated in July 1941 by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia against the German occupation forces and their Serbian quisling auxiliaries in the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia. At first the Yugoslav Partisans had mounted diversions and conducted sabotage and had attacked representatives of Acimovic's quisling administration. In late August some Chetniks joined the uprising and liberated Loznica. The uprising soon reached mass proportions. \n\nPartisans and Chetniks captured towns that weak German garrisons had abandoned. The armed uprising soon engulfed great parts of the occupied territory. The largest liberated territory in occupied Europe was created by the Partisans in western Serbia, and was known as the Republic of Uzice. Rebels shared power on the liberated territory; the center of the Partisan liberated territory was in Uzice, and Chetniks had their headquarters on Ravna Gora."

    germany_1941.6.d:0 "Due to the collapse of the Yugoslav Army, the general population of Montenegro had easy access to large amounts of military arms and ammunition. By July 1941, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia had over 1,800 members and another 3,000 youth members, located in the area of Montenegro, Kotor and the Sandzak. Most of these were ready to commence an armed uprising against the Axis powers and the occupying Italians in particular. Grievances mainly related to the expulsion of Montenegrin people from the Kosovo region and Vojvodina, as well as the influx of refugees from other parts of Yugoslavia. Other refugees were fleeing the terror of the Ustaše in the regions along the borders with Bosnia and Herzegovina. \n\n But the event that triggered the uprising was the proclamation of a restored Kingdom of Montenegro headed by an Italian regent and led by Montenegrin separatist Sekula Drljević and his supporters, known as \"Greens\". This proclamation was announced by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It was issued to the Italian-convoked assembly of Montenegrin separatists held on 12 July 1941. The uprising broke out the following day."
