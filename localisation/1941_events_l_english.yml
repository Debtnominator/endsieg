news_1941.1.d:0 "On [GetDateText], Kiev, capital of the Ukrainian SSR, has been captured by the advancing German armies in the Soviet Union. \n\nThe capture of one of their most important cities is a serious blow to the Soviets, but the question still remains whether the Germans can keep up their momentum.
