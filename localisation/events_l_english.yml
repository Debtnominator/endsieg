However, the party's pursuit of increasing [Root.GetName]'s focus on military matters has not been entirely popular with the public, with a significant segment of the citizens considering this ill-advised jingoism. War is yet to reach our border and few would like to see [Root.GetName] take aggressive action. Cooperating with other major parties who share our concerns for the safety of the nation, we will still be able to rule after the election, albeit with diminished support."

One of these in particular has won favor in the current election, leading to discussions within the [Root.GetRulingParty] party about whether or not we should try to cooperate with them in forming our government. While they openly reject the democratic ideals that are the foundation of our state, the fact that they choose to participate in the election itself lends some credibility to our views and acknowledging their public support may keep them away from taking violent action."

election.5.t:0 "Election: Communists in Government?"
election.5.d:0 "The communist movement in [Root.GetName], fueled by broad dissatisfaction among the working class and radical trends among academics, has grown large enough to lead to the formation of several parties. After one of these has gained considerable support in the current election, politicians in [Root.GetRulingParty] have started debating whether or not to seek their support in forming a government.

Totalitarian governments of similar ideological leanings see us as potential allies. Maintaining ties to these nations, no matter the distaste [Root.GetRulingParty] may have for their ideals, may be necessary to retain the support of the fascists backing our government."

While the new rulers claim to represent the people as a whole, they view many of the democratic institutions we cherish as attempts to manipulate and oppress the working class, leading to discussion about what truly constitutes a 'rule of the people'. In some nations, the revolution began in rivers of blood. In [Root.GetName] it didn't, but it may yet end in them."

He has openly advocated an authoritarian government and praised foreign administrations that identify as fascist, implicitly suggesting that [Root.GetName] would benefit from such rulership. Denouncing the magnate and his ideals might sour our relationship with the company, but leaving them unchecked would give him a platform for spreading propaganda that erodes all that [Root.GetRulingParty] stands for."

Meanwhile, others claim that declaring the ongoing war a valid reason for skipping elections is the first step towards eroding [Root.GetAdjective] democracy. After all, letting military matters take precedence over the people's influence could be a slippery slope."

They question whether the electorate has any power at all, or if it's all just for show.\n\nHowever, the support for [Root.GetLeader] appears to remain high, and although the circumstances of the election are questioned by international community, it has not been contested domestically. It appears that even if [Root.GetName] is no longer ruled by the people, the people support their ruler... at least the ones who made it to the ballots."

However, the fact remains that the majority of the people seem to have reservations about their rule, and the opposition, although silenced for now, has made its point."

If nothing else, they see room for addressing the concerns of the people who look to communists for solutions without risking a full-scale civil war.\n\nAlthough they may be seen as traitors by those who remain loyal to [Root.GetLeader], these dissident voices may be the ones to ensure a relatively bloodless transition should the revolution come."

endsieg_political.3.d:0 "While the popular movement for communist revolution has been loud and terrifying, a certain section of the political movement has been largely quiet and waiting. The wait is now over. Today, just as the [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership and army were bracing for a revolt on national scale, a number of officials in the [Root.GetAdjective] government swiftly placed [Root.GetLeader] under house arrest and entered negotiations with the rebels.\n\nWhile retaining a pretense of safeguarding order, what the negotiations effectively amounted to was to secure positions within the new socialist state for those who chose to cooperate. The coup was finished before anyone could move to stop it, and those who would have are now imprisoned, exiled or executed by the new regime."

endsieg_political.4.d:0 "The communist revolutionary movement, once a fringe popular among radical academics in theory and troublemakers in practice, has seen increased support among the [Root.GetAdjective] working class. The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Marxist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost. Their concerns are not unfounded. It could be argued that a revolution is already underway, occurring on several levels of society, and it may be too late to stop it."

Instead of taking up arms against workers who struggle abroad, raise them against the oppressors and overthrow the tyrants!'\n\nThe army, usually a bastion of patriotism and loyalty, has proven not to be immune to the communist propaganda spreading rapidly in [Root.GetName].

endsieg_political.6.d:0 "The notion that the communist movement represents the people has certainly gotten wind in its sails in [Root.GetName], where the public support for the communist party has increased rapidly in the past months. But those who call for revolution are no longer a disparate collection of guerrillas and disgruntled labor unions. The group behind the call for revolt is organized enough to form a government if they succeed.\n\nNevertheless, if the revolution started now, it could hardly be executed without launching [Root.GetName] into civil war. Should the revolutionaries risk tearing the nation in two to satisfy their impatience, or wait for a better opportunity in the future?"

They feel the [Root.GetRulingParty] has forgotten how important force of arms is to keeping the country together, and are increasingly annoyed by the army being treated by the government as more of a tool than a one of the nation's most important institutions. Some of them go as far as to suggest that a new government is needed, one that knows how to lead [Root.GetName] into the next half of the century.\n\nThis faction may not predominantly be politicians, but some of them have gained positions in the department of defense. If these developments continue, they may have sufficient political support to execute a coup."

Both those who warned against the dangers of fascism and those who extolled it as the savior of [Root.GetName] have found their prophecies made reality today, as the military in [Root.Capital.GetName] overthrew the [Root.GetRulingParty]-led government and seized power. [Root.GetLeader] is missing, rumored to have gone into exile, and the coup has been met with little initial resistance.\n\nThe new [Root.GetAdjective] leadership has no plans to allow resistance to grow, either.

The generals plotting to overthrow the current administration are disappointed in the lack of confidence the [Root.GetAdjective] population themselves seem to have in [Root.GetFascistParty].\n\nThey remain certain that the people will eventually tire of [Root.GetLeader], but are divided on what course of action to take. Some call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."

In parallel with its growing political movement, fascist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of fascism are beginning to look very much alike."

Look no further than across our border to see countrymen having turned on each other in the name of communism, declaring the end of nations. How long until they declare our nation dead as well? Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the fascist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss fascism as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well.

stability.21.desc.a:0 "A new report by the War Office shows a marked reduction in available manpower. It appears that the latest batch of recruits is much smaller than initially expected. The discrepacy is currently under investigation, but first leads point towards a large number of people who are technically fit for service managing to avoid the draft through various means. 18 year old students are suddenly skilled workers employed in critical war industry, former athletes fail their fitness tests and in some cases, recruits have simply vanished without a trace.\n\nWhen people are caught and interrogated, they point towards the poor conditions in the army, the indifferent officers and not wanting to die for a lost cause. Military leaders demand a harsh crackdown on people avoiding the draft, but many in the government believe that improving the living conditions of enlisted soldiers might be the better approach."
stability.21.desc.b:0 "The ineffective official response to the widespread avoidance of the draft has only made the problem worse. More and more recruits never show up after receiving their drafting letter. Counter-Intelligence has intercepted a professionally made pamphlet advising people on how to avoid the draft, suggesting things like bribing doctors to certify the recruit to be medically unfit. Exceptions for family fathers have led to war widows with children finding themselves mobbed with marriage proposals while the number of people applying for exceptions for ethical reasons have hit record numbers.\n\nMilitary leaders have suggested eliminating the last few exceptions and make examples out of a few shirkers that have been caught. Others in the government have suggested that we should appeal to the sense of civic duty in our citizens and point out the consequences of a defeat in this war."
stability.21.desc.c:0 "With government responses to draft dodging having no positive effects whatsoever, more and more people have started to wonder why they should put themselves at risk while others stay in safety. Recruits that do turn up often report being harrassed or ridiculed in the streets as fools fighting for a doomed cause. Reports of mothers forbidding their children from answering the draft order are everywhere, and the War Office has submitted a report claiming that they are no longer sure how many people they are supposed to draft, as their bureaucracy has started to break down under the strain of processing all those missing soldiers."

stability.22.desc.a:0 "Production in several factories has slowed down dramatically over the last few days as the workers have declared a strike on all war production. Demanding "Peace and Bread!", they have so far refused all attempts to negotiate a settlement. Some in the government have advocated a sharp military response, followed by a swift execution of the ringleaders as enemy agents and traitors. However, others in the civil service have recommended a more measured approach, pointing out that a heavy-handed response may well backfire if the soldiers involved are not as loyal as we thought they were."
stability.22.desc.b:0 "Government efforts to convince the strikers to return to work seem to have had no effect whatsoever. On the contrary, strikes have been reported in further factories, and the last few hold outs in the originally affected work sites have also put down their tools after facing the anger of their colleagues. While stockpiles have so far been able to cushion the blow to front line supplies somewhat, it is only a question of time before the production outages start to affect our ability to prosecute the war.\n\nThe War Office has again urged the government to take an unyielding line with the strikers, but other factions inside the administration have suggested that offering to meet the workers half-way may be enough to convince them to return to work."
stability.22.desc.c:0 "What started as industrial action in a few isolated places has now spread across the entire country, affecting even industries that are only connected to the war effort in tertiary ways. Even the workings of the government itself have become affected, as many low level clerks, messengers, and drivers have refused to show up to work in increasing numbers. \n\nIn many places, worker councils have taken over the factory buildings. Reports from the secret police indicate that some places seem to have started production of weapons again - for a major uprising against what is being called "The War Regime".\n\nMilitary High Command believes that decisive action by loyal troops could still win the day, while the civilian side of the government argues that this risks a civil war and certain defeat."

Still in their nightgowns, they have found themselves conscripted into the military and escorted to the barracks under armed guard, where they will be formed up into a separate unit, to avoid their subversive influence from spreading to other units. \n\nThe news of this has spread quickly, and it appears that most people who until now believed that they could get away with ignoring their draft notice have changed their mind.

Still in their nightgowns, they have found themselves conscripted into the military. Their families have mobilized their extensive support networks to protest this descision. The War Office has been flooded with calls and letters from simple workers who want their factory manager back to undersecretaries in various other ministeries, demanding to know why people working in fields critical to the war effort have been removed from their work.

The regent of Hungary, Horthy had planned a quiet holiday with his family in the royal palace. Charles had been informed by his Swiss entourage whom told the former emperor of promises from European royalist circles and prompted Charles to take advantage of ‘this quiet’ against the warnings of his many supporters and Horthy himself whom said the time was not right to return to the throne. This did not change his stance as he was optimistic. His secret negotiations with Aristide Briand the French Prime Minister promised French Support if he was to succeed and no armed intervention from Hungary’s neighbors the ‘Little Entente’ whom were very willing to all invade Hungary if a Habsburg came back to power. Charles left his Swiss villa arriving undetected at Szombathely on the 26th of March where he made his way to the palace of Count Janos Mikes a prominent legitimist, from there the news spread like wildfire amongst local legitimist and by the 27th of March Charles had already acquired a small privy council including Horthy’s Minister of Education. After Charles met with the Prime Minister, Pal Teleki, he replied to Charles saying “too soon, too soon” before Charles and urged him to return back to Switzerland saying a civil war would break out with an intervention of the Little Entente. Charles made a final agreement to meet with Horthy and once he arrived at the palace, he was completely unannounced just as Horthy was sitting down to an Easter dinner with his wife. After Horthy finished his soup he led Charles to the Regent’s Office and had a two hour ‘emotional’ discussion with Charles which Horthy described as “the most difficult moments in my entire life”. Charles thanked Horthy for his service as regent but said the time came to “hand over the power to me” with Horthy replying “This is a disaster. In the name of God, Your Majesty must leave at once and return to Switzerland, before it’s too late and the powers learn of your presence in Budapest”. Charles frustrated said he “burned his bridges” speaking in German he continuously argued with Horthy and reminded him of his tearful pledge of loyalty made at the Schonbrunn Palace in November 1918 and the sworn oath of obedience to him from which he was never released. Horthy retaliated he sworn an oath to Hungary and Charles shocked said he would stick by his position and gave Horthy 5 minutes to think over it. Horthy was skeptical of Charles’s claims of assurance from PM Briand and reiterated his fear of civil war. Horthy expected Charles to leave Hungary and either march on Vienna or retire to Switzerland."

By April 3rd, the French PM Briant denied any deal being made which severely weakened Charles’ position. With the army still loyal to Horthy, Charles reluctantly left by train on the 5th of April reaching Hertenstein Palace that day. He still proclaimed himself to be the rightful Hungarian ruler two days later which showed up on the newspaper and the Swiss government placed stricter limits on his political activity. Charles left Hungary with a great dislike toward Horthy believing that the Great powers would not oppose restoration and that he was holding the power for his own personal reasons. He thought the Hungarian people yearned for his return, though no demonstrations of support occurred in Hungary during the Easter Crisis except minor scale demonstrations in traditionally royalist counties. People had generally treated him with indifference and Teleki resigned on the 6th of April with his poor handling of affairs."

hungary.9.d:0 "On October 23rd 1921 a Treaty of Versailles-mandated plebiscite was scheduled to occur in Burgenland, due to this Count Gyula Ostenburg-Moravek and Colonel Lehar as well as other legitimist officers decided to take advantage of the tense situation sending Charles a message that he should seize power before the 23rd of October saying that he would expect no opposition due to the political situation and his restoration would be greeted everywhere. Charles whom got the message after dictating his will made a daredevil flight (the plane’s engine stopped working several times) in an Ad Astra Aero Junkers F.13 monoplane landing surreptitiously in Western Hungary on a field belonging to a legitimist and from there making his way to Sopron. He had no intention to seek compromise with Horthy whose cabinet he considered illegitimate and formed his own provisional government. That day a group of armored trains were being equipped in Sopron guarded by Ostenburg’s troops who were told a communist rebellion erupted in Budapest with Horthy calling on Charles to restore order. The battalion took the traditional Honved oath of Loyalty to ‘Charles of Hapsburg, King of Hungary, and King of Bohemia’. From there they departed to Budapest 190 km away in the late morning. The armada stopped at each village station to have the local garrison and public officials take the oath of loyalty and to allow groups of loyal peasants chant ‘Long live the King!’ and pay homage to the royal couple. This took approximately 10 hours which then had allowed Horthy to regroup. A report reached Horthy late on October 21st and he was shocked Lehar and Ostenburg betrayed him and Horthy communicated his decision that force would be used if necessary citing the danger Hungary would be destroyed and made a military proclamation he would keep power and demanded loyalty from his army. Most who were stationed along the Royal Armada's path found it impossible to be disloyal to Charles. As Charles approached Budapest the Entente powers reaffirmed their opposition to the restoration and Czech, Yugoslav, and Rumanian ministers made it clear such a move would be regarded as a Casus Belli. Horthy then sent a letter telling Charles, begging him to give up but the latter did not even read the letter."

Martial law at this time was already declared in Budapest. Czechoslovakia at the same time reported and claimed to be mobilising. Thomas Hohler the British envoy was convinced all was lost anticipating that Charles would ender Budapest that afternoon. Horthy received news that if the legitimists launched an attack the defense of Budapest would collapse. General Pal Hegedus who was a legitimist allied with Charles met with Hohler the British envoy whom informed him that Britain “Would never recognise Charles and would never permit the return of a Habsburg.”. Later warning Budapest if taken by Royal Troops would be overrun by the Czechs within a week. Hegedus now denied being associated with Charles and offered brokering an armistice after learning that Charles' assurances that the Great Powers backed him were false. Horthy later that day met with a large volunteer force which had been guarding the city giving a speech warning if Charles came to power A-H would be revived and Hungary once again would resume her inferior position. He also said that Charles’ army consisted mostly of “Austrian and Czech Volunteers”. This emboldened the army which began firing on Charles's forces. After news of the Battle of Budaors (A village close to Budapest) was spread much of Charles' supporters were surprised and lost morale thinking the march would be Budapest. After Charles’ army saw that Horthy was determined to resist and found that Charles and his officers lied that there was an eruption of a Bolshevik rebellion in budapest support grew to Pro-Horthy. By now Charles reluctantly agreed to an armistice and arranged a truce the next morning."

In return of this all supporters of the restoration, “except agitators and ringleaders”, would be amnestied. Whilst Charles read these terms shots rang out and a stray bullet hit the royal train and the train started to move westward with Lehra and Ostenburg calling for a ‘Last Stand’ and ‘Fight to the last drop of blood’, but Charles was largely reluctant to do this and ordered the train to stop and opened the window yelling  "Lehár! Ostenburg! Stop and come back here! I forbid any more fighting! It's all quite senseless now...". He then dictated the final surrender order.

Death threats and threats of violence were made against Radic in parliament and he was warned of an assassination attempt against him however he replied he was like a soldier in the war, in the trenches, and such was his duty to go. In the Assembly, Punisa Racic, a member of the People's Radical Party got up and made a provocative speech which produced a stormy reaction from the opposition but Radic stayed compeltely silent, as Punisa Racic made his way to the speaker podium facing the Croats he put his hand in his pocket where he held a revolver, as he pulled out his gun Minister Vujicic grabbed his gun but he broke himself free and fired shots which killed Radic. This would lead to Alexander I later abolishing the constitution, dissolving parliament, and declaring a royal dictatorship."

By 1921 the ruling Qajar dynasty of Persia was known for being corrupt and inefficient, it was reliant on Britain and Russia for military and economic support. Civil war was a constant threat and the only military force at the time was the Cossack Brigade. In 1921 the Qajar Shah, Ahmad was crowned at the age of 11 and thus was considered to be a weak and incompetent ruler. In general the Qajar government's reputation had severely suffered and proved to be powerless in time of war, even the United Kingdom was dismayed by the government's inability to rule efficiently and Persia remained a power struggle between Britain and russia. On 14 January, 1921, British General Ironside chose to promote Reza Khan who led a Tabriz Battalion to lead an entire brigade a month later under British direction to reach Tehran. On February 18, 1921, the Cossacks reached Tehran meeting little resistance, only several policemen taken by surprise were killed or wounded.

Both prisoners were brought before a firing squad in the early morning of 7 February 1920. According to eyewitnesses, Kolchak was entirely calm and unafraid, "like an Englishman." The Admiral asked the commander of the firing squad, "Would you be so good as to get a message sent to my wife in Paris to say that I bless my son?" The commander responded, "I'll see what can be done, if I don't forget about it." A priest of the Russian Orthodox Church then gave the last rites to both men. The squad fired and both men fell. The bodies were kicked and prodded down an escarpment and dumped under the ice of the frozen Angara River. When the White Army learned about the executions, its remaining leadership decided to withdraw farther east. The Great Siberian Ice March then followed.

While he was being interrogated the Soviets publicly claimed he was shot trying to cross the Finnish border.

The games were a significant propaganda victory for the German regime, which spent lavishly on the event.\n\nGerman athletes saw the most success, winning 33 gold medals, while the Americans came in second, with 24.

jews.104.t:0 "The Fall of Kiev"
jews.104.d:0 "Kiev, capital of the Ukrainian SSR, has been captured by the advancing German armies in the Soviet Union. \n\nThe capture of one of their most important cities is a serious blow to the Soviets, but the question still remains whether the Germans can keep up their momentum. Moments after the Germans had occupied the city, thousands of mines planted by the NKVD were apparently detonated in buildings along the Khreshchatyk main street, causing even more damage to the already ruined city.\n\nNow the invading forces look to the east."
jews.105.t:0 "The Fall of Stalingrad"
jews.105.d:0 "Advancing German spearheads have seized Stalingrad, Stalin's namesake city on the banks of the Volga. \n\nAfter fighting their way through the ruined Stalingrad Tractor Factory and seizing the strategically vital Mamayev Kurgan heights, the Germans have forced the last Soviet defenders across the Volga to its eastern shore. According to unconfirmed reports, holdouts from the Red Army fighting together with partisans have retreated into sewers and basements to continue their struggle. \n\nNo significant organized resistance is believed to remain, however."
jews.106.t:0 "The Fall of Moscow"
jews.106.d:0 "At dawn today, German panzers smashed through hastily erected barriers on the streets of Moscow and half-tracks were seen unloading Panzergrenadiers on Red Square. \nThick, billowing smoke from the many fires raging in the suburbs could be seen rising into the air as German infantry stormed the Kremlin. Grenades and flamethrowers were reportedly needed to fight stubborn NKVD holdouts intent on defending every inch of the complex. The Russian capital is now in German hands, but has been left a burning ruin. \n\nUnconfirmed reports indicate Lenin's embalmed corpse was safely evacuated east."

jews.107.d:0 "The heavily fortified city of Sevastopol, base of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, has finally succumbed to German attacks. \n\nIts loss will severely hamper any Soviet attempt to contest the Black Sea, and the fall of the city is regarded as a significant German victory.\n\nAn edict has already been issued from Berlin, stating that the city shall henceforth be known as 'Theodorichshafen' after Theodoric the Great."
jews.108.t:0 "The Fall of Baku"
jews.108.d:0 "Earlier today, German forces successfully occupied the city of Baku, a vital strategic objective in their war against the Soviet Union. \n\nLocated on the shores of the Caspian Sea, the city is the key to the Caucasus, and its many oil fields are sure to benefit the German war effort.\n\nIts capture puts Germany in a position to expand the war into the Middle East and possibly even India."
jews.109.t:0 "The Fall of Cairo"
jews.109.d:0 "Forces from the Deutsches Afrikakorps have fought their way to Cairo, the capital city of Egypt. \n\nAs Allied forces retreated further into the desert in disarray, German soldiers marching through Cairo were cheered as liberators by many citizens who had come to view the British as oppressors.\n\nThe fall of Cairo is a significant loss to the Allied war effort, and several experts have speculated that all of the Middle East now lies open to German conquest."
jews.110.t:0 "The Fall of Washington"
jews.110.d:0 "Fighting in the area of Washington D.C. came to an end today, when the last pockets of resistance in the city were eliminated by German forces advancing along the Potomac. \n\nA dense layer of smoke hangs over the city, and at least some of it reportedly comes from OSS agents who were burning sensitive documents up until the very last moment. A Waffen-SS detachment secured the White House after a brief firefight with members of the US Secret Service, but it is believed that the President was safely evacuated several days ago.\n\nThe fall of the American capital illustrates the terrible might of the German war machine."
jews.111.t:0 "The Fall of New York"
jews.111.d:0 "After hours of street warfare, much of it reportedly against armed irregulars, German spearheads have advanced into New York City and taken control of the city. \n\nImprovised anti-tank barriers placed along Fifth Avenue proved ineffective, and Panzergrenadiers fought their way through Manhattan, block by block.\n\nFires have been raging out of control in the eastern parts of the city for several days now, lighting up the skyline at night. \n\nThe Statue of Liberty was decapitated by a stray artillery round, though which side fired it remains a matter of dispute."
jews.112.t:0 "The Fall of Gibraltar"
jews.112.d:0 "After several conflicting reports, it has now been confirmed that Gibraltar has fallen to Germany. \n\nThis strategic port city guards the entrance to the Mediterranean, and it was widely regarded as impregnable before the war started. The British garrison retreated into the tunnels running underneath the Rock, but were eventually dislodged by flamethrowers and grenades. \n\nWith Gibraltar in German hands, there has been a dramatic shift in power in the Battle of the Mediterranean."
jews.113.d:0 "Jubilant Italian soldiers entered Cairo today, moments after the last British units retreated from the city. \n\nA victory parade was immediately organized, and Italian soldiers flocked to the Great Pyramids of Giza to have their pictures taken in front of the famous landmarks.\n\nWith Cairo under his control, Mussolini is now one step closer towards linking Italian East Africa with Italian Libya and forming a contiguous colony in Africa."
jews.113.b:0 "Another conquest for Italy!"
jews.114.d:0 "The last pockets of French resistance in Paris were mopped up today, and the city is now firmly under Italian control. \n\nIl Duce was hurriedly flown in to participate in the victory parade on the Champs-Élysées, riding in front of the marching troops on a white stallion. During the celebrations, he compared the current campaign in France with Caesar's conquest of Gaul, and promised that it was only the beginning of Italy's ascent to greatness.\n\nTime will tell if he is right."
jews.115.d:0 "Italian forces have successfully stormed London, and the il Tricolore has been hoisted over the Victoria Tower. Minor fighting continues in some parts of the city, and in an incident this morning several Bersaglieri were gunned down by snipers hidden at the top of Big Ben.\n\nAfter three failed attempts to dislodge them, the entire clock tower was brought down by demolition charges in what Italian officials are describing as a 'regrettable overreaction' by the local commander."
jews.116.d:0 "Italy appears to be in control of Gibraltar, after what has been reported as heavy fighting around the Rock and the harbor. Occasional explosions can still be heard from the military tunnels running deep under the Rock, but Italian officials claim an end to all organized resistance.\n\nWith this vital gateway to the Mediterranean under Italian control, British naval forces will be hard-pressed to challenge the Regia Marina in the region."
jews.117.t:0 "The Fall of Singapore"
jews.117.d:0 "Singapore, the 'Gibraltar of the East,' has been seized by Imperial Japanese forces despite having been considered an impregnable fortress by its former British owners.\n\nThe Japanese Military Administration of Singapore has chosen the Fullerton Building as its headquarters, and the city has been renamed Syonanto, which roughly translates to 'Southern Island gained in the age of Showa.' The Kempeitai can be seen patrolling the streets en masse to hammer in the message that the Japanese are there to stay."
jews.117.b:0 "For the Emperor!"
jews.118.t:0 "The Fall of Pearl Harbor"
jews.118.d:0 "Japanese forces have stormed and taken Honolulu, the largest city on the Hawaiian island of O'ahu. The naval base at Pearl Harbor, former headquarters of the US Pacific Fleet, has also fallen.\n\nAccording to witnesses, beleaguered American sailors and Marines retreated to Ford Island, where they continued to offer stubborn resistance until they were subjected to an intense artillery and aerial bombardment. With this island under its control, the long reach of the Imperial Japanese Navy has become greater still."
jews.119.t:0 "The Fall of New South Wales"
jews.119.d:0 "Further expanding on its conquests in the south, the empire of Japan has seized Sydney and the Australian capital Canberra. Local defenders were forced to retreat across the Sydney Harbour Bridge to new positions on Observatory Hill, but attempts to demolish the bridge were thwarted by advancing Japanese forces, who then pushed on to take Canberra.\n\nThe Japanese war flag can now be seen hanging from the Parliament House in Canberra, which serves as the headquarters of the area's new military administration, and the Kempeitai military police are maintaining a watchful eye on the streets."
jews.120.t:0 "The Fall of Los Angeles"
jews.120.d:0 "After establishing a foothold on the American mainland, Japanese forces have converged on Los Angeles and routed the city's defenders. A long procession of Imperial troops marched down Central Avenue this afternoon while Japanese newsreel photographers filmed the event.\n\nBefore American forces retreated, fighting was reportedly fierce in several areas of the city. Hollywood suffered particularly heavy damage, and many Japanese officers have had their pictures taken in front of the perforated and crumbling Hollywood Sign."
jews.121.t:0 "The Fall of Nanjing"
jews.121.d:0 "The capital of the Republic of China, Nanjing, has been occupied by forces from the Empire of Japan. Despite fierce resistance from the walled city's Chinese defenders, Japanese troops managed to capture Zhongshan Gate and fought their way into the city.\n\nSporadic gunfire can still be heard and several fires are raging in different parts of the city, but most surviving Chinese forces have either withdrawn or been captured. Along with the capture of Shanghai, this is a significant victory for Japan in their war against China."
jews.122.t:0 "The Fall of Vladivostok"
jews.122.d:0 "Vladivostok, the largest city in the Russian Far East and home of the Soviet Pacific Fleet, has been stormed by Japanese troops. Its strategic position at the far end of the Trans-Siberian Railway makes its loss all the more detrimental to the Soviet war effort in Asia.\n\nMany of the city's inhabitants still remember the Japanese occupation that lasted for several years during the Russian Civil War. This time, some fear they may never leave."
jews.123.t:0 "The Fall of Hong Kong"
jews.123.d:0 "Troops from the Empire of Japan have captured the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong after breaking through the Gin Drinkers Line and landing on Hong Kong Island itself. The situation soon became untenable for the defenders, and the Governor surrendered in person at the Peninsula Hong Kong hotel where the Japanese had established their headquarters.\n\nAfter a brief ceremony, a new Japanese governor was installed who announced a 'New Hong Kong' to the world, 'free of Western colonialism.'"
jews.124.t:0 "The Fall of Manila"
jews.124.d:0 "Manila, capital of the Philippines, has fallen to the Japanese after the withdrawal of its American and Filipino defenders. The entrance to the strategically vital Manila Bay remained contested for some time after the city's fall due to the heavy concentration of American coastal artillery on Corregidor Island, but the guns eventually fell silent after a concerted Japanese attack.\n\nWith Manila under Japanese control, the rest of the Philippines are expected to follow shortly after. This is a stinging defeat for American forces in Asia and the Pacific."
jews.125.t:0 "The Fall of Calcutta"
jews.125.d:0 "After a period of heavy bombardment, it has now been confirmed that the city of Calcutta in India has fallen to advancing Japanese forces. Even while sporadic fighting was still occurring in the outskirts of the city, a victory parade was quickly organized on Chowringhee avenue.\n\nMembers of the Indian National Army, a military outfit organized by the Japanese and dedicated to the liberation of India from Britain, took part in the parade and drew wild cheers from the crowds. With the fall of Calcutta, many predict that all of British India will soon follow."
jews.126.t:0 "The Fall of New Delhi"
jews.126.d:0 "Japanese offensives continue in India, and the fall of New Delhi recently took place. As the capital of British India, this city is of immense strategic importance and its loss may prove to be a decisive factor in the ongoing Indian campaign.\n\nThe Viceroy himself was reportedly captured by Japanese forward units while he was supervising the transfer of his belongings from the Viceroy's House to a truck caravan, but this has not yet been confirmed."
jews.127.t:0 "The Fall of the Panama Canal"
jews.127.d:0 "In what must be considered a monumental blow to the American war effort, Japanese forces have landed in Panama and taken control of the canal after forcing the surrender of its garrison. Several parties of American and Panamanian soldiers reportedly escaped into the nearby jungle to wage guerrilla warfare, but it is not believed that they can significantly threaten the Japanese presence.\n\nWith the fall of the canal, American naval forces now have to round South America to reach the US West Coast, giving the Imperial Japanese Navy a significant strategic advantage."
jews.128.t:0 "The Fall of Berlin"
jews.128.d:0 "The capture of the German capital has been confirmed by officials in Washington, after US forces fought their way into Berlin from several directions. Fighting in the city was described as intense, with the Moltke Bridge being demolished by desperate German pioneers to halt the American advance.\n\nOther bridges over the Spree were eventually secured, and GIs successfully stormed the Kroll Opera House and the Reichstag despite fierce German resistance. The Stars and Stripes now flutters in the wind above the Reichstag, and fighting in the city has ceased. The Battle of Berlin is over."
jews.128.b:0 "A textbook operation!"
jews.129.d:0 "British forces have advanced into Berlin, and the War Cabinet has announced the successful capture of the German capital after a pitched battle. Striking at dawn, British commandos seized the Tempelhof Airport while armored columns advanced along the Frankfurter Allee.\n\nWith the Reich Chancellery under British control, fighting in the city has largely ended. The current status of the German government remains unclear, but it is believed that at least some elements of it escaped the city before its fall."
jews.129.b:0 "Smashing good job, lads!"
jews.130.d:0 "French forces have successfully stormed the German capital, which fell after a series of pitched battles within the city limits. A large group of Waffen-SS soldiers barricaded themselves in the Olympiastadion, which eventually fell after a determined attack by Foreign Legionnaires supported by artillery.\n\nThe French tricolor can now be seen flying over the Reich Chancellery, and although sporadic fighting is still being reported from some suburbs, most of Berlin is believed to have been cleared of organized resistance."
jews.130.b:0 "Vive la France!"
jews.131.d:0 "Desperate fighting has been reported from Berlin, the capital of Germany, but it is now believed that the city is completely in Polish hands. After advancing along the Frankfurter Allee, the Poles reached the Alexanderplatz which was the scene of a pitched battle.\n\nElsewhere in the city, the Brandenburg Gate collapsed, supposedly after being rammed by a Polish tank, and the Kroll Opera House was leveled by an artillery barrage after its stubborn SS defenders refused to surrender. The red and white of the Polish flag now flies above the Reichstag, and the last pockets of resistance have been dealt with."
jews.131.b:0 "The Polish juggernaut cannot be stopped."
jews.132.t:0 "The Fall of Rome"
jews.132.d:0 "Allied forces recently entered Rome after the surrender of its garrison, and the city is now under military occupation. Most historical landmarks remain intact, having weathered yet another battle for control over the city. For now at least, Allied troops have stayed outside Vatican City at the request of the Holy See.\n\nThe fall of Rome is an important milestone in the Italian campaign, and some are wondering if this means an end of the organized resistance to the advancing Allied armies on the peninsula."
jews.132.b:0 "A great victory!"
jews.133.d:0 "Forces from France recently entered Rome after the city's remaining Italian garrison melted away into the surrounding countryside. The French troops moved quickly to occupy all significant government buildings, and a 'triumph' was held along the Via del Corso by a long procession of marching soldiers and armored vehicles.\n\nWith the fall of Rome, the ability of Italy to continue the war is put into question. Outside observers expect that the Italian government, who fled the city just before its fall, will soon begin surrender negotiations."
jews.134.t:0 "The Liberation of Paris"
jews.134.d:0 "It has now been confirmed that Paris, the capital of France, has been liberated from German occupation. Allied forces have entered the city, and the remaining German garrison has surrendered. Parisians could be seen cheering their liberators as they marched down the Champs Élysées, even while there were rumors of German sniper fire in some parts of the city.\n\nIt was feared that the Germans would employ a strategy of scorched earth and leave Paris a burning ruin, but the city's landmarks appear to have been spared. Indeed, the French tricolor can even now be seen flying from the Eiffel Tower."
jews.135.t:0 "The Fall of Tokyo"
jews.135.d:0 "American forces have entered Tokyo, and the US War Department recently announced an end to major combat operations in the city. Fighting was reported as heavy, particularly in the vicinity of the Imperial Palace which was defended by fanatical members of the Imperial Guard, even though the Emperor is believed to have left the city before the American assault began.\n\nWith the fall of Tokyo, experts predict that organized resistance on the rest of the Japanese Home Islands will soon crumble. Peace negotiations are expected to begin shortly, unless Japanese hardliners convince the Emperor to continue the fight to the death."
jews.136.d:0 "After a series of pitched battles, Allied forces have occupied Moscow, capital of the Soviet Union. The city has suffered extensive damage, and fires are still raging on both sides of the Moskva river. Despite heavy bombing the Kremlin is reasonably intact, and it has been chosen as the location for the headquarters of the Allied Occupation Administration.\n\nWith the loss of Moscow, the Soviet war effort has suffered an enormous blow. Although most of the government is believed to have evacuated the city well in advance of its fall, military experts claim that a complete Soviet collapse may not be far away."
jews.137.t:0 "The Liberation of London"
jews.137.d:0 "Fighting has ended in London, with the last pockets of German resistance having been dealt with. As soon as the all-clear was given, jubilant crowds rushed onto the streets to celebrate their American liberators, while church bells could be heard ringing throughout the city.\n\nLiberation fever seems to be embracing Britain, as it now finally appears likely that the German occupation is coming to an end. Spontaneous uprisings have been reported in areas still under German control, though these incidents have been dealt with harshly. Has freedom at last returned to the United Kingdom?"
jews.138.d:0 "Unlike 1920, there was no 'Miracle at the Vistula' when Soviet armies recently approached Warsaw. Polish resistance in the city has largely collapsed, and the Soviet flag can be seen raised over most government buildings.\n\nAre we witnessing the end of the Polish nation, or will their forces somehow manage to rebound and retake their capital? Most experts consider this scenario unlikely."
jews.138.b:0 "Onwards, comrades!"
jews.139.t:0 "The Liberation of Warsaw"
jews.139.d:0 "The devastated city of Warsaw has fallen to advancing Soviet armies, after the last German defenders retreated from its burning suburbs. Much of the city lies in ruins after previous battles, and local resistance members hurriedly emerged from the rubble to greet their liberators.\n\nWith Warsaw under Soviet control, the strategic situation for Germany in Eastern Europe may soon deteriorate further. Experts are doubtful that they will be able to mount a counterattack to retake the city, but the harried local population does not seem quite as convinced."
jews.139.a:0 "Is this the beginning of the end...?"

This, of course, assumes that the Red Army is unable to retake the city in a counteroffensive."
