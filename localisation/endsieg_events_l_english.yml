    ww1_germany.70.d:0 "Now that we are at war, it is time to choose our warplan. Will we choose the Schlieffen plan, which goes through Belgium and Luxemburg to circumvent the heavily fortified French lines, or will we do the exact same but through Switzerland with the Rupprecht Plan. Finally we have the option to ignore other fronts, and force Russia out of the war first."
